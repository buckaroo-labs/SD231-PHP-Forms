Lab exercise

1. Clone this repository (anywhere on your computer) and then copy the `index.php` file in it to the document root of your PHP-enabled web server (e.g. `C:\Program Files\Ampps\www`).
2. Point your browser to this `index.php` file (`http://localhost/` should do it unless another file takes precedence or you are running the server on a non-default port).
